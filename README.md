## About The Project
Prescriptions for medicines that are only available in pharmacies can be issued as electronic prescriptions (e-prescriptions resp. E-Rezepte) for people with public health insurance from 1 July 2021.
The official gematik E-Rezept App (electronic prescription app) is available to receive and redeem prescriptions digitally. Anyone can download the app for free:

The e-prescriptions are stored in the telematics infrastructure, for which gematik is responsible.

You can find more documentation about each module [here](https://gematik.github.io/E-Rezept-App-iOS).

### Installation
To set up the project and install dependencies, run:

```bash
make setup
```
This will ensure all dependencies are in place and the Xcode project is generated.

You'll need a running implementation of `IDP` and `FD`. Reference implementations are available for [`IDP`](https://github.com/gematik/ref-idp-server) and [`FD`](https://github.com/gematik/ref-eRp-FD-Server).

To build the app for release, run:

```bash
make build
```

Note: Make sure you have run `make setup` before and have code-signing set up for your local or CI build.

### Functional Requirements

The underlying requirements can be found within the Gematik [Fachportal](https://fachportal.gematik.de). Search for "E-Rezept Frontend des Versicherten".

A mapping of these requirements can be found within the [documentation](https://gematik.github.io/E-Rezept-App-iOS). To generate the mapping from requirements to implementation run `bundle exec fastlane list_requirements`.

## Usage
