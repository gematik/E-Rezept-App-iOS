[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_20525] Not applicable as authenticator modul is within FdV. Consent is given by using the app.
[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_21578] iOS only allows Biometric access via secure enclave or higher order apis.
[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_21583] Secure Enclave is enforced with code attributes.
[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_21584] There is no API to allow or disallow an biometric authentication, iOS is handling the authorization process while using the private key for any cryptographic operation.
[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_21585] Default behaviour for all apps when using private access group (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/sharing_access_to_keychain_items_among_a_collection_of_apps)
[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_21586] iOS will delete all user related data after user-accout reset. Key-Chain data is not beeing synced with iCloud since `kSecAttrSynchronizable` is not applied  
[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_21590] References of `SecureEnclaveSignatureProvider` is limited to registration and altVerify usage.
[REQ:gemSpec_IDP_Frontend:A_20608,A_20608-01,A_20609,A_20618,A_20068-01]: Implemented with ATS within `Info.plist`, path: `NSAppTransportSecurity.NSPinnedDomains`

[REQ:gemSpec_eRp_FdV:A_19086,A_19087#1] Tracking is only implemented for the purpose of Usability-Tracking. Sessions are not persisted, session ids are recreated each app startup.
[REQ:gemSpec_eRp_FdV:A_19093#1,A_19094] Usage Tracking is called very sparse and boils down to one place where all visited screens are recorded. See usage of `@Dependency(\.tracker)` for all cases where the actual analytics framework is used.
[REQ:gemSpec_eRp_FdV:A_20193,A_20194] Camera is only used for scanning recipes and avatar setup. CoreLocation is used for pharmacy search. Usage is requested before actual first usage, the user is asked for permission. This is also enforced by the OS.
