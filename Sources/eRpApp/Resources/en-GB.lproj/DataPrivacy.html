<p>The e-prescription app is the official app for e-prescriptions in
Germany. gematik publishes the app as the National Agency for Digital
Medicine on behalf of the legislature. gematik is also responsible for
the data protection of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Further information</strong></p>
<p>Gematik's official information on e-prescriptions in Germany can be
found at <a
href="http://www.das-e-rezept-fuer-deutschland.de">www.das-e-rezept-fuer-deutschland.de</a>
. There you will receive understandable information and answers to
frequently asked questions about e-prescriptions.</p>
<h1 id="about-this-privacy-policy">About this privacy policy</h1>
<p>In this data protection declaration we inform you about data
processing by the e-prescription app. We strive to provide an
understandable presentation of the technical processes. If we haven't
been able to do this, please let us know. You can find our contact
details under contact person .</p>
<p>This data protection declaration does not apply to the services of
other providers who provide the central e-prescription systems. These
services include the prescription service, the identity service and the
pharmacy directory . Information about the responsible providers of
these services can be found under Other responsible parties .</p>
<h1 id="what-is-this-app-for">What is this app for?</h1>
<p>If you receive an electronic prescription from your doctor, it will
be stored encrypted in the prescription service. The prescription
service is the central prescription storage in the German health
network. The e-prescription app allows you to securely access the
prescription service and receive, manage and redeem e-prescriptions.</p>
<h1 id="is-using-the-app-voluntary">Is using the app voluntary?</h1>
<p>Yes, using the e-prescription app is voluntary. You are also not
obliged to provide specific data in the app or to register. However, if
you do not log in, you will not be able to use all of the app's
functions.</p>
<h1 id="how-and-why-is-your-data-processed">How and why is your data
processed?</h1>
<h2 id="set-up-profiles">Set up profiles</h2>
<p>You must set up at least one “profile”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The profile data is only saved on your device.</p></li>
<li><p>The profile name is used for clear display. He is freely
selectable.</p></li>
<li><p>You can set up multiple profiles to manage e-prescriptions for
relatives.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="register-for-the-prescription-service">Register for the
prescription service</h2>
<p>Only the patient (or a representative), the prescribing doctor's
office and the filling pharmacy may access the data in the prescription
service. For every access to your data in the prescription service, your
identity must therefore be proven in order to check the access
authorization. The <strong>identity service</strong> is responsible for
this identity check . Information about the provider of this service can
be found under Other responsible persons .</p>
<p>prove your identity with your electronic health card (eGK) and a
suitable app from your health insurance company :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you log in with the eGK, the digital authentication
certificate on the chip is read contactlessly (via NFC) and transmitted
to the identity service. You give your consent by entering your PIN. The
authentication certificate contains your insured person master data
(e.g. your name and your insurance number) and is considered electronic
proof of identity. Once the identity service has verified the
authentication certificate and confirmed your identity, it issues an
access key (token) to the e-prescription app. The e-prescription app can
use this to log into the prescription service.</p></li>
<li><p>When you sign up with an app, you must first select your health
insurance so that the e-prescription app can connect to the “correct”
app. The e-prescription app retrieves the list of health insurance apps
available for this purpose from the identity service. After you share
your identity data with the e-prescription app via your health insurance
app, it forwards the data to the identity service for verification. If
your identity can be confirmed, the identity service of the
e-prescription app will issue the access key (token) for logging in to
the prescription service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After signing in, your e-prescriptions and dispensing information
stored in the prescription service will be downloaded and additionally
stored on your device.</p>
<p>If you manage your e-prescriptions via the e-prescription app, your
activities will be transferred to the prescription service and
implemented there. These activities include, for example, granting
access rights and deleting e-prescriptions.</p>
<h2 id="save-login-data">save login data</h2>
<p>If you are logged in, you can activate the “Save credentials”
function for future logins. The access data - consisting of PIN, CAN,
authentication certificate and access key (token) - are then stored in a
protected area of your device so that they can be used again. This
feature can only be activated if your smartphone has a secure app access
protection mechanism. Apple iPhones with Touch ID or Face ID and Android
devices with “Strongbox Keymaster” security module currently meet this
requirement.</p>
<h2 id="scan-and-redeem-prescription-codes">Scan and redeem prescription
codes</h2>
<p>If you want to save a prescription code and redeem it at a pharmacy
via the app, you must first scan it with the camera. Scanning creates an
electronic copy of the prescription code. This step takes place
exclusively on your device, which means no internet connection is
required. You can then redeem the e-prescription at a pharmacy using the
app:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are logged in to the prescription service and assign the
e-prescription to a pharmacy for redemption via the app, this will be
documented in the prescription service and the prescription status will
be changed to “in redemption”. The pharmacy then receives access rights
to the e-prescription stored in the prescription service. There is no
direct communication between the app and the pharmacy. You can view the
current processing status, which is managed by the recipe service, at
any time in the app.</p></li>
<li><p>send the prescription code directly to the pharmacy along with
your other order details (e.g. whether you want to pick up the
medication or have it delivered) . In this case, the app communicates
directly with your pharmacy's communication system. The prescription
service is not involved in this communication and is therefore not
informed about the order. For your convenience, the transmitted
e-prescription will be marked as “sent” in the order overview of your
app. The app receives the access data for the pharmacy's communication
system from the pharmacy directory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Note for Android devices:</u></p>
<p>In order to be able to scan recipe codes error-free even under
unfavorable conditions (e.g. poor camera resolution or lighting
conditions), the app uses a special interface (Barcode Scanning API from
Google ML Kit) with your consent. This interface is part of the Google
Play Services, which is already installed on your device. The camera
image is analyzed exclusively on your device. However, as with all
Android devices with Google Play Services, Google reserves the right to
collect certain usage and device data when using the interface (for ML
Kit, for example: manufacturer, device model, operating system version,
hardware, mobile operator, time zone, language settings , IP address,
app version, configuration of ML Kit, number of scans, error messages)
within the operating system and transmitted to a Google server for
further development of the interface. It cannot be ruled out that this
data will be transferred to a third country (e.g. USA), see Who will
your data be passed on to ? You can revoke your consent to use the
Google ML Kit at any time by deactivating the camera permission of the
e-prescription app in the Android settings . Further information can be
found in Google's notes on ML Kit <a
href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning">https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning</a> and in the <a
href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de">Google data protection
declaration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pharmacy-search">Pharmacy search</h2>
<p>When using the pharmacy search, your search criteria (e.g. addresses
or location data) are transmitted to the <strong>pharmacy
directory</strong> . The pharmacy directory then provides the app with a
list of pharmacies that match the search criteria.</p>
<p><u>Note for Android devices:</u></p>
<p>With your consent, the app uses the map service Google Maps to view
the map. The app then transfers your location (if you have approved it)
and the locations of the pharmacies found to an interface in your
operating system (Google Maps interface). This interface is part of the
Google Play Services, which is already installed on your device. Please
note the “Note for Android devices” under Scanning and redeeming
prescription codes in connection with Google ML KIT, which also applies
to the Google Maps interface. When using Google Maps, <u>Google's Terms
of Use for Google Maps/Google Earth</u> and the <u>Google Privacy Policy
apply</u> .</p>
<h2 id="notifications-to-pharmacies">Notifications to pharmacies</h2>
<p>The e-prescription app enables direct encrypted and confidential
communication between you and pharmacies.</p>
<p>If you are logged in to the prescription service, communication with
the pharmacy takes place via the prescription service, which also
archives the messages. The app loads the messages from the recipe
service and saves them on your device so that you can see the current
status even without registering. Neither the prescription service
provider nor gematik have access to the messages exchanged.</p>
<p>If you are not logged into the prescription service, you can use the
app to send messages directly to your pharmacy's communication system.
The app receives the access data for the communication system from the
pharmacy directory. The prescription service is not involved in the
communication. Please note: In order to receive messages and view
message histories, you must log in to the prescription service.</p>
<h2 id="digital-cost-receipts-for-privately-insured-people">Digital cost
receipts (for privately insured people)</h2>
<p>As a privately insured person, you can agree to receive digital cost
receipts in the app. Your consent will be noted on the prescription
service and can be revoked at any time in the app. If you have agreed,
you will only receive cost receipts from pharmacies in digital form via
the prescription service. You can use the app to manage your digital
cost receipts stored on the prescription service and save them as PDF
documents that can be submitted electronically. For easy electronic
submission, you can also share the PDF documents directly with your
health insurance provider's submission app.</p>
<h2 id="security-features">Security features</h2>
<h3 id="connected-devices">Connected devices</h3>
<p>The “Save credentials” function can be activated on multiple devices.
Any device on which you have this feature enabled is called a “connected
device”. All connected devices are managed centrally on the identity
service. To do this, the e-prescription app transfers device information
to the identity service for clear differentiation: manufacturer, device
model, device name, operating system version and device name (e.g.
“Anna’s iPhone”). The identity service stores this information. To help
you keep track, you can see on which devices you have saved your access
data under “Connected devices” in the “Settings” area.</p>
<p>If you want to deregister a connected device, you can do so on that
device or another connected device. The identity service then deletes
the device information and access keys it has stored. The access keys
stored on the deregistered device will also be deleted.</p>
<p>Please note: If a connected device model or its operating system
version is deemed unsafe, the Identity Service may deregister the device
in question. The identity service then deletes the device information
and access keys it has stored. . You can then log in to the recipe
service again on the deregistered device, provided the security problem
has been resolved by an operating system update.</p>
<h3 id="integrity-checks">Integrity checks</h3>
<p>Smartphones can be operated with a manipulated operating system
(so-called “jailbreaking” or “rooting”). Not every affected user is
aware that their operating system has been manipulated (e.g. with
devices purchased second-hand) and the security risks associated with
this. A technical check of the operating system is carried out every
time the e-prescription app is started. If evidence of manipulation is
detected, a warning is displayed. You can then continue to use the app
at your own risk without any restrictions.</p>
<p>For jailbreak detection on Apple devices, the e-prescription app
checks the device memory for evidence of apps that can only be installed
on jailbroken devices (e.g. Cydia app).</p>
<p>A security function of the operating system is used to detect root on
Android devices. To do this, the app generates a random number and
information about the e-prescription app (e.g. version) and transfers it
to a special interface in your operating system (SafetyNet Attestation
API). This interface is part of the Google Play Services, which is
already installed on your device (see Scan recipe codes ). The SafetyNet
Attestation API then evaluates information about your device and the app
that is only accessible to Google Play Services. This evaluation
provides conclusions about possible manipulation of the operating
system. The result is communicated to the e-prescription app.</p>
<h3 id="app-access-lock">App access lock</h3>
<p>To make it more difficult for unauthorized access to your
e-prescription app, it can be automatically locked every time you close
it. Every time it is opened, it must first be unlocked. Depending on
what security features your smartphone has, password-based and biometric
methods are available.</p>
<p>Please note: If you activate the “Save access data” function, the app
lock is also automatically activated.</p>
<p>If you enable password protection, your password will be checked
locally during setup to ensure it is sufficiently strong. The password
is only saved on your device.</p>
<p>When using a biometric procedure, the security functions of your
smartphone are used. The e-prescription app does not receive any
biometric data, but only the result of the biometric check by your
operating system.</p>
<h2 id="push-notifications">Push notifications</h2>
<p>In future versions of the app, you will be able to receive push
notifications about communications from pharmacies or new
e-prescriptions. To do this, your smartphone registers with the push
service of your operating system. The following push services are used:
Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android), Apple Push Notification (Apple),
Huawei Push Kit (Huawei).</p>
<p>The respective push service provides the e-prescription app with a
push identifier. The push identifier is then transmitted from the
e-prescription app to the prescription service. If a push message is to
be sent to you, the recipe service sends a message with your push
identifier to the push service used, which then forwards it to your
smartphone. The pharmacy's message remains on the prescription service
and is only loaded when you open the e-prescription app.</p>
<h2 id="usage-analysis">Usage analysis</h2>
<p>If you allow usage analysis, general usage data (e.g. type and extent
of use and operation of the app functions) and information about the
hardware and software used (e.g. type, version and manufacturer of the
device and operating system) as well as selected settings (e.g. language
setting) will be collected ) transmitted. The usage data is only
evaluated anonymously. You can revoke your consent at any time by
deactivating usage analysis in the settings. Your usage data will then
no longer be transferred to gematik. You will receive further
information before activating usage analysis in the e-prescription
app.</p>
<h1 id="who-will-your-data-be-shared-with">Who will your data be shared
with?</h1>
<p>If you have agreed to the usage analysis, the app will transmit your
usage data to gematik's technical service provider for usage analysis
(Content Square GmbH) based on your consent.</p>
<p>Otherwise, gematik has no access to the data stored on your device.
The app only shares your data with other providers and other third
parties in accordance with How and why is your data processed? described
scope further.</p>
<p>Neither the e-prescription app nor the providers of the prescription
service, the identity service or the pharmacy directory transfer your
data to countries where an adequate level of data protection does not
exist and European data protection laws may not be enforced (so-called
third countries, e.g. USA).</p>
<p>However, we would like to point out that using the e-prescription app
generates usage data on your operating system. The manufacturers of the
operating systems partially reserve the right to log and evaluate this
data. This may also result in device and usage data being transferred to
the USA or another third country. In this respect, it is possible that
security authorities in a third country access the data transmitted to
the manufacturer and evaluate it, for example by linking data with other
information about you.</p>
<h1 id="when-will-your-data-be-deleted">When will your data be
deleted?</h1>
<p>gematik does not store any personal data from users of the
e-prescription app . Therefore, no deletion is necessary or possible on
gematik’s part.</p>
<p>You can delete the recipe data, recipe codes, cost receipts and
messages stored on your device in the app itself. The e-prescriptions in
the prescription service are automatically deleted after 100 days from
issue or last change in status (Section 360 Paragraph 11 SGB V). Cost
receipts are deleted from the prescription service after 10 years
(Section 360 Paragraph 13 SGB V).</p>
<p>Access logs in the recipe service are not stored on your device and
cannot be deleted. They are automatically deleted from the prescription
service after three years (§ 309 SGB V).</p>
<p>If you delete a profile, all data associated with it, including data
downloaded from the recipe service and stored access data, will be
deleted. The saved access data will also be deleted if you deactivate
“Save access data”.</p>
<p>If you disable push notifications in the e-prescription app, the push
identifier stored on your device will be deleted.</p>
<p>Uninstalling the e-prescription app will delete all data stored by
the e-prescription app on your device.</p>
<h1 id="your-privacy-rights">Your privacy rights</h1>
<p>With regard to the usage data transmitted to gematik with your
consent, you have the right to information (Art. 15 GDPR), correction
(Art. 16 GDPR), deletion (Art. 17 GDPR), and restriction of processing
(Art. 18 GDPR). ) and data portability (Art. 20 GDPR). <strong>You also
have the right to revoke your consent (see Usage Analysis</strong>
<strong>).</strong> Please note that gematik stores your usage data in
anonymized form. It is no longer possible to assign this data to you
personally, so that the data protection rights mentioned above no longer
apply (Art. 11 Para. 2 GDPR, Section 308 SGB V). You also have the right
to complain to a data protection supervisory authority. The data
protection supervisory authority responsible for gematik is the Federal
Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information <a
